## 🚀 About Me
I’m a third-year university student in web development, now making the big leap into **DevOps & Cloud Engineering**.  
My background in building web projects (like GlamourHub) gave me a foundation in coding, but I’m now focused on the tools and systems that keep applications running smoothly — **Linux, automation, containers, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure**.

I believe in learning by doing, so my GitHub is a mix of:
- **Labs**: hands-on practice with Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD.
- **Notes**: everything I’m learning about Linux, networking, scripting, and cloud.
- **Projects**: small tools, automation scripts, and experiments.

## 📍 My Current Learning Roadmap
- ✅ **Linux essentials** – navigation, permissions, processes, networking basics
- ✅ **Bash scripting** – automating repetitive tasks
- 🔄 **Docker** – building and running containers
- 🔄 **Kubernetes** – orchestration basics
- 🔄 **CI/CD pipelines** – GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- ⬜ **Terraform & Cloud** – AWS/Azure deployments
